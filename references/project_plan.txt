Significance testing is widely and extensively conducted in finance research. It is an essential
tool to establish statistical evidence of an association or relationship among the financial
variables of interest.

QUESTIONS:
- does the mad money guy make predictions? Are his predictions based in any kind of science when he talks about stocks?
Is the underlying mean return on this mutual fund different from the underlying mean return on its benchmark?
Did the volatility of returns on this stock change after the stock was added to a stock market index?
Are a securityâ€™s bid-ask spreads related to the number of dealers making a market in the security?
Do data from a national bond market support a prediction of an economic theory about the term structure of interest rates (the relationship between yield and maturity)?


A hypothesis is a statement about one or more populations.
The steps in testing a hypothesis are as follows:
1. Stating the hypotheses.
2. Identifying the appropriate test statistic and its probability distribution.
3. Specifying the significance level.
4. Stating the decision rule.
5. Collecting the data and calculating the test statistic.
6. Making the statistical decision.
7. Making the economic or investment decision.

level of significance, sample size, power of the test, and
expected losses.

specifically, Leamer (1978) suggests that the level of significance be adjusted as a decreasing
function of sample size for sensible hypothesis testing. Klein and Brown (1984) make the
same point in the context of model selection in the linear regression, with an observation that
a smaller model is rejected too easily in large samples under a fixed level of significance.
