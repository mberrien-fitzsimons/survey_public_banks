PRESENTATION OVERVIEW:
we obtained a dataset snapshot of latest available data of their key statistics (market information, ie, average volume,
market cap, earnings per share).we have another dataset that is a time series nature. It gives opening, closing, highs and
lows. First experiment with snapshot data and first see if there are any stocks that had significantly different volume to
market capitalization, or per ratio, or eps. To establish the fact that they are statistically different, we thought we could
use sample mean t-test. If we find something different then we thought we are going to zoom into historical trade data for
intraday.

TIMELINE:
Wednesday @ early morning - Done w. Coding
Wednesday @ 3:30 - Group Presentation
Wednesday @ 5:30 - Science Fair

DELIVERABLES:
- Jupyter Notebook containing any code you've written for this project.
- "Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation that explains the hypothesis tests you ran, your findings, and
their relevance to company stakeholders.
- ReadMe write-up for Github Repo

Statistical Analysis: List of Hypothesis Tests on Learn.co:
1. T-Tests
2. chi-squared test (Misha)
3. ANOVA (Dmitry)
4. re-sampling method

---------------------------------------------------------

POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:

1. Intraday variance as difference between high and low (stock)
2. Is there a bank out there whose daily volume is significantly different from everyone else (most
popularly traded banks). Average 10 day volume/ market cap. For this we could do a T test and ANOVA.


---------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
- Is the underlying mean return on this mutual fund different from the underlying mean return on its benchmark?
- Did the volatility of returns on this stock change after the stock was added to a stock market index?
- Are a securityâ€™s bid-ask spreads related to the number of dealers making a market in the security?
- Do data from a national bond market support a prediction of an economic theory about the term structure of
interest rates (the relationship between yield and maturity)?
- TTM:  Earnings per share should be approximately the same across banks (this is the hypothesis). We can
do this by testing the different
EPS against the mean value of the banks. (New column would need to be created "TTM Earnings")
