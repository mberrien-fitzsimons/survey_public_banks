DELIVERABLES:
- Jupyter Notebook containing any code you've written for this project.
- "Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation that explains the hypothesis tests you ran, your findings, and their relevance to company stakeholders.

Statistical Analysis: List of Hypothesis Tests on Learn.co:
1. T-Tests
2. chi-squared test
3. ANOVA
4. re-sampling method

---------------------------------------------------------

POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:

1. - Intraday variance as difference between high and low (stock)
2. Is there a bank out there whose daily volume is significantly different from everyone else (most popularly traded banks).
- average 10 day volume/ marketcap. For this we could do a T test and ANOVA.

---------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
- Is the underlying mean return on this mutual fund different from the underlying mean return on its benchmark?
- Did the volatility of returns on this stock change after the stock was added to a stock market index?
- Are a securityâ€™s bid-ask spreads related to the number of dealers making a market in the security?
- Do data from a national bond market support a prediction of an economic theory about the term structure of interest rates (the relationship between yield and maturity)?
- TTM:  Earnings per share should be approximately the same across banks (this is the hypothesis). We can do this by testing the different
EPS against the mean value of the banks. (New column would need to be created "TTM Earnings")

HYPOTHESIS TESTING STEPS:
A hypothesis is a statement about one or more populations.
The steps in testing a hypothesis are as follows:
1. Stating the hypotheses.
2. Identifying the appropriate test statistic and its probability distribution.
3. Specifying the significance level.
4. Stating the decision rule.
5. Collecting the data and calculating the test statistic.
6. Making the statistical decision.
7. Making the economic or investment decision.
